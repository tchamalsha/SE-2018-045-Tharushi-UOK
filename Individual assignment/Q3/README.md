#Create a Button GUI Program (10 Points)

For this assignment you will create a Java program that display a GUI program with buttons
similar to this:
This GUI is the start of a simple number entry GUI class. The program displays four Buttons and
every time the user clicks on a button, the corresponding button label appears on the bottom of
the GUI. As a hint, you might break up the design of the GUI into two parts: one part holds the
buttons, the other holds the completed GUI. Also include a main ( ) to launch the GUI.
public class SimpleButtons implements ...... {
SimpleButtons( ) { } //constructor
// event handler here
public static void main( String args[ ] ) { } // main here
}
When you have this Assignment ready for me to view and grade you should upload your .java
file in the Discussion Folder for this assignment.
