# Create a Box Class (10 Points)
For this assignment you will create a Java class named Box that models a heavy "Box" with the
following characteristics:
1. The class has four private integer instance variables L1, W1, H1, Weight to store the
Length, Width, Height, and Weight of the Box. Measurements are in feet and pounds.
2. This class has two constructors:
○ Constructor #1 - has no parameters and initializes the Box's instance variables to
0
○ Constructor #2 - has four integer parameters that initializes the Box object's
L,W,H,Weight
3. This class has a method calculateVolume( ) which returns the volume (formula:
L1*W1*H1) of the Box object as an integer
4. This class has a method calculateDensity( ) which returns the density of the Box
(formula: weight/volume) as a double, check for divide by 0.
5. This class contains a main( ) method which creates an instance of the Box object with
L1=10, W1=5, H1=5, Weight=2600 and computes the Box's Volume and Density, then
outputs the results to the user's screen.
When you have this Assignment ready for me to view and grade you should upload your .java
file in the Discussion Folder for this assignment.
